Using a TTL Serial Interface
============================

The NRZ data that comes out of the SWO is just UART formatted, but in
a frame.  Orbuculum has been extended to accomodate TTL Serial Dongles
that can pick this up.  Success has been had with CP2102 dongles at up
to 921600 baud.

To use this mode just connect SWO to the RX pin of your dongle, and
start swolisten with parmeters representing the speed and port. An
example; 

>./orbuculum -p /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART -b swo/ -s 921600 -c 0,text,c

Any individual dongle will only support certain baudrates (Generally
multiples of 115200) so you may have to experiment to find the best
supported ones.  For the CP2102 dongle 1.3824Mbps wasn't supported and
1.8432Mbps returned corrupted data. 

Please email dave@marples.net with information about dongles you find
work well and at what speed.

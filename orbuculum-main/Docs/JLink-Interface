Using a JLink Interface
=======================

The SEGGER JLink is capable of issuing SWO data via TCP port 2332.
Orbuculum simply connects to that and then re-issues the data using
its standard mechanisms.

To use this mode just connect SWO to the JLink and then configure the
JLink to process the SWO data. This is done using the incantations
you will find in the gdbinit-jlink file in the Support directory.

For information about the Segger-specific commands in there I'm
afraid you will need to refer to the Segger documentation.

This has been tested on a Segger JLinkPro V4 H/W with DLL 6.16d. Please
let dave@marples.net know what success you have with other configurations.
